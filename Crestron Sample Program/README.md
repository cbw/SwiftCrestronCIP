# SwiftCrestronCIP: Sample Crestron Program

This sample Crestron program is a counterpart to the [Swift sample application](../CIPSampleApp).

It just does some basic things: an interlock for latching two digital signals, sends an analog value received back out to the panel (with an optional delay), and echos a serial join back to the output.
