This Swift module was inspired by [Katherine Lenae's Python CIP client](https://github.com/klenae/python-cipclient).

This is a Swift-based socket client that facilitates communications with a Crestron control processor using the Crestron-over-IP (CIP) protocol. Familiarity with and access to Crestron's development tools, processes and terminology are required to configure the control processor in a way that allows this module to be used.

Usage information, and example iOS app and Crestron program coming soon.
